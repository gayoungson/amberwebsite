<!--How to make a blog post

library(distill)
create_post("New Post Title")

New posts are saved in the folder '_posts' in their own folder starting with the date created. Open the post ending with .Rmd, in this case new-post-title.Rmd.

After editing, make sure to *knit* your new post before rendering the site, otherwise it will not show up.
